## How to Use

- When the app loads, it fetches a random dog image from [https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random](https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random).
- While the image is being fetched, a `<p>` element with the text "Loading..." is displayed.
- Once the image is loaded, it's shown inside an `<img>` tag.
- Clicking the `<button>` fetches a new random dog image.
